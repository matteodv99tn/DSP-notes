\chapter{Continuous and discrete time Fourier Transform}
	
	Let's assume to have a continous signal $x(t) \in \mathds C$, we can define it's transform as
	\begin{equation}
		X(\Omega) := \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j\Omega t} \, dt \quad \in \mathds C
	\end{equation}
	where $\Omega$ is a \textbf{frequency} expressed in radians. In general not all signal can be transformed. The discrete time counter-part, applied to a discrete signal $x(n) \in \mathds C$ (where $n\in \mathds Z$) using the normalized $x$ axes, is the discrete-time fourier transform defined as
	\begin{equation}
		X\left(e^{j\omega}\right) := \sum_{\infty}^{n = - \infty} x(n) e^{-j\omega n}
	\end{equation}
	where this time $\omega$ is not measured as $[rad/s]$, but it's just a pure number expressed in $[rad]$ (not divided by the time). In fact given the sampling time $T_s$ of the discrete signal, we can see the relation between $\Omega$ and $\omega$ as $\omega = \Omega T_s$. Notice that working with the variable $\omega$ is more general because the \textbf{\textit{spectrum}} generated by the transform isn't related to the sampling time $T_s$, but in a more general way.
	
	\paragraph{Inverse transform} Given a transform $X(\Omega)$ of a continuous-time signal, to retrieve back the function in the domain of time we need to use the \de{Fourier Inverse Transform} defined as
	\begin{equation}
		x(t) := \frac 1 {2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty X(\Omega) e^{j\Omega t} \, d\Omega
	\end{equation}
	Given instead a discrete-time transform X(n), the definition of the inverse transform is done as
	\begin{equation}
		x(n) = \frac 1{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi X\left(e^{j\omega}\right) e^{j\omega n}\, d\omega
	\end{equation}
	and the integral definition is due the fact that $\omega$ is a continuous variable; the integrating range is defined as $[-\pi,\pi]$ cause the angle is a periodic function with period $2\pi$, and so integrating in a wider range won't give any new features to the signal.
	
	\paragraph{Relationship with other transforms} The Fourier transform is related to the Laplace transform defined as
	\[x(t) \xrightarrow{\mathscr{L}} X(s) := \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) e^{-st} \, dt \]
	where $s = \sigma + j\omega \in \mathds C$ is a complex variable. In general if the Laplace transform of a function exists, also the Fourier counter-part exists, because we can see the Fourier transform as
	\[ X(\Omega) = X(s) \big|_{s = j\Omega} \]
	so it's the frequency axes of the complex plane of the Laplace transform. In reality some function can have the Fourier transform even if the Laplace one cannot be computed.
	
	In the discrete time case the relation is between the Z transform $\mathscr{Z}$ defined as
	\[x(n) \xrightarrow{\mathscr{Z}} X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(n) z^{-n}  \qquad z \in \mathds C \]
	where $z$ is a complex variable. Comparing this transform with the discrete-time Fourier one, we can see that by replacing $z$ as $e^{j\omega}$ we can see that they are equal:
	\[ X\left(e^{j\omega} \right) = X(z) \big|_{z = e^{j\omega}}\]
	Considering that $|e^{j\omega}| = 1 \ \forall \omega$, this means that $e^{j\omega}$ represent a circle in the complex plane with unitary radius and $\omega$ is the angle that describes the point in the circle.
	
	\paragraph{Existence conditions of the Fourier transform} In general there's no guarantee that the integral/sum converges in order to get the transform; in particular we can define the \textbf{sufficient condition} (but not necessary) that says that if the signals $x(t), x(n)$ are absolutely summable (such that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty |x(t)|\, dt < \infty$, $\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty |x(n)| < \inf $) then $X(\Omega), X(e^{j\omega})$ exists.
	\begin{proof}
		To prove this sufficient condition for the continuous time case, we need to consider that
		\begin{align*}
			|X(\Omega)| = \left| \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) e^{-j\Omega t}\, dt \right| \leq \int_{-\infty}^\infty |x(t)|\underbrace{ \left|e^{-j\Omega t}\right|}_{=1} \, dt
		\end{align*}
		So if the integral of $|x(t)|$ converges, also the Fourier transform exists.
	\end{proof}
	
	It's possible to have function that are not absolutely summable but for which the Fourier transform exists.
	
	\textbf{ESEMPIO DI INVERSIONE DI UNA TRASFORMATA RETTANGOLARE}
	
	A weaker necessary condition for the existence of the Fourier transform is that if $X(\Omega)$ (or $X(e^{j\omega})$) exists, than it's necessary that $x(t) = \lim_{\Omega \rightarrow \infty} \frac 1 {2\pi} \int_{-\Omega}^\Omega X(\Omega) e^{j\Omega} \, d\Omega $, or in a more general way the necessary condition of the existence of the transform is that the energy signal converges to a finite number (and so it's not divergent).
	
	\paragraph{Relationship between Fourier transform and series} 
	The Fourier transform and series are related, but are two different things: the \textbf{series} is the composition in the \textbf{time domain} of the components of the signal, while the \textbf{transform} changes the shape of the signal from time to \textbf{frequency domain}.
	
	By expressing the Fourier series with the complex notation
	\[ c_m = \frac 1 T \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} x(t) e^{-\frac{2\pi j m t}{T} } \, dt \]
	where $x(t)$ is a periodic function with period $T$; if we extract the signal in a period as
	\[\tilde x(t) = \begin{cases}
		x(t) \qquad & t \in [-T/2,T/2] \\ 0 & \textrm{otherwise}
	\end{cases} \]
	\[ \Rightarrow \quad \tilde X(\Omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \tilde x(t) e^{-j\Omega t} dt = \int_{-T/2}^{T/2} \tilde x(t) e^{-j\Omega t} dt \]
	This equation allows us to express the coefficients $c_m$ by using the Fourier transform.
	
	
	\paragraph{Property} The transform property are
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the Fourier transform is a \textbf{linear operator}, so for every signals $x_1(t),x_2(t)$ that has a transform associated, for every coefficients $a,b\in \mathds R$ it happens that
		\[ \mathscr{F} \big\{ a x_1(t) + b x_2(t) \big\} = a \mathscr{F}\big\{x_1(t)\big\} + b \mathscr{F}\big\{x_2(t)\big\}\]
		\begin{proof}
			To proof this property we have to use the linearity property of the integration:
			\begin{align*}
				\int_{-\infty}^\infty \Big(a x_1 (t) + bx_2(t)\Big) e ^{-j\Omega t} \, dt = a \int_{-\infty}^\infty x_1 (t)  e ^{-j\Omega t} \, dt + b \int_{-\infty}^\infty x_2 (t)  e ^{-j\Omega t} \, dt 
			\end{align*}
		\end{proof}
		
		\item \textbf{time shifting}: considering a signal $x(t)$ shifted in time axes by a value $t_0$ (such that $x \rightarrow x(t-t_0)$ ), than
		\[ \four{x(t-t_0)} = e^{-j\omega t_0} \four{x(t)} \]
		
		\item \textbf{convolution operation}: \textit{convolution} is an operation performed between signal that in the continuous time case defined for the signals $x,h$ like
		\[y(t) = x(t) * h(t) := \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau) h(t-\tau)\, d\tau \]
		In the discrete time case the convolution is defined as $y(n) = x(n)*h(n) := \sum_{u=\infty}^\infty x(n) y(n-u)$. This operation allows us to determine the response of the system for every input by only knowing the impulse input. The property associated to the convolution states that
		\[ \four{x(t) * h(t)} = \four{x(t)} \four{h(t)} \]
		\begin{proof}
			\begin{align*}
				\four{x(t) * h(t)} & = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau) h(t-\tau)\, d\tau \right) e^{-j\Omega t} \, dt \\
				& =  \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau) e^{-j\Omega \tau} \underbrace{\left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(t-\tau) e^{-j\Omega(t-\tau)} \, dt \right)}_{=\four{h(t)}} \, dt \\
				& = H(\Omega) \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(\tau) e^{-j\Omega \tau} \, d\tau = X(\Omega) H(\Omega)
			\end{align*}
		\end{proof}
	
		\item \textbf{differentiation in frequency property}: given a signal $x$ that has Fourier transform, then
		\[\four{t\, x(t)} = j \frac{d X(\Omega)}{d\Omega} \qquad \four{n \, x(n)} = j \frac{dX(e^{j\omega})}{d\omega} \]
		
		\begin{proof}
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty n x(n) e^{-j\omega n} & = \frac{-j}{-j}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x x(n) e^{-j\omega n} \\
			& = j \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x(n) \frac{de^{-j\omega n}}{d\omega} \\
			& = j \frac{d}{d\omega}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x(n) e^{-j\omega n} = j \frac{dX(e^{j\omega})}{d\omega}
		\end{align*}
		\end{proof}
		
		\item \textbf{symmetric property}: if $x(t)\in \mathds R$ is a real valued signal, than
		\[ X(-\Omega) = X^*(\Omega) \]
		\begin{proof}
		\begin{align*}
			X(-\Omega) & = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) e^{-j (-\Omega) t} \, dt = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) \left(e^{-j\Omega t}\right)^* \, dt \\ 
			& = \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) e^{-j\Omega t} \, dt\right)^* = X^*(t)
		\end{align*}
		\end{proof}
		From this property we can state that the \textbf{magnitude spectrum} $|x(\cdot)|$ (and so the real part of the spectrum) is always an even function, while the \textbf{phase spectrum} $\angle x(\cdot)$ (thus the imaginary part of the spectrum) is an odd function.
